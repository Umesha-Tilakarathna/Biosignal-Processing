# Biosignal-Processing

Contains the theoretical and practical knowledge based tasks completed for the biosignal processing module. Delved deep into the mathematical concepts underlying odigital filters, adaptive filters, and regression methods, and applied them through practical examples. Time-frequency methods like STFT, CWT, DWT, and WPT were also studied to gain insights into signal analysis. Did feature extraction and preprocessing using PCA, ICA, EMD, VMD, and CSP, enhancing understanding of data reduction and signal decomposition.
