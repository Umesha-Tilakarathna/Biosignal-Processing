# BM4152 Biosignal Processing

This repository contains the solutions to the BM4152 Biosignal Processing assignments, which involve advanced MATLAB-based signal processing techniques applied to biomedical signals. These focus on the theoretical and practical knowledge based tasks completed for this module. Here, we delved deep into the mathematical concepts underlying digital filters, adaptive filters, and regression methods, and applied them through practical examples. Time-frequency methods like STFT, CWT, DWT, and WPT were also studied to gain insights into signal analysis. We also did feature extraction and preprocessing using PCA, ICA, EMD, VMD, and CSP, enhancing understanding of data reduction and signal decomposition.
