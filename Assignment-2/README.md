Through this assignment, 

- Implemented Wiener filtering in time and frequency domains for ECG signal denoising.
- Studied the effect of non-stationary noise on Wiener filtering performance.
- Developed and compared LMS and RLS adaptive filters for noise cancellation.
- Analyzed the impact of parameters like filter order, convergence rate, and forgetting factor on filter performance.

### 1. Wiener Filtering
1. **Time-Domain Implementation**: 
   - Filtered ECG signals with white noise and interference.
   - Optimized filter order, calculate weights, and analyze the filtered results.
2. **Frequency-Domain Implementation**: 
   - Used frequency-domain formula for filtering and compare results with time-domain.
3. **Non-Stationary Noise**: 
   - Analyzed filtering performance when noise frequency changes mid-signal.

### 2. Adaptive Filtering
1. **LMS Algorithm**: 
   - Implemented LMS for adaptive noise cancellation and analyze the impact of convergence rate and filter order.
2. **RLS Algorithm**: 
   - Implemented RLS and compare with LMS in terms of performance and parameter effects.
