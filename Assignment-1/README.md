This assignment focuses on implementing and analyzing signal processing techniques using MATLAB for noise reduction, signal enhancement, and filter design:

# Smoothing Filters:

Applied Moving Average (MA) and Savitzky-Golay (SG) filters for noise reduction, evaluated filter performance using MSE and PSD, and compared filter characteristics.

# Ensemble Averaging:

Enhanced signal quality for ABR data using synchronized averaging and analyzed SNR improvements.
Processed noisy ECG signals by segmenting pulses via cross-correlation, performing ensemble averaging, and improving SNR.

# FIR Filter Design:

Designed FIR filters using the Rectangular and other smoother windows (e.g., Hamming, Hanning) and studied their effects on magnitude and phase response.
